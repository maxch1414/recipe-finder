What I was thinking on creation,

Should I handle this in different pages or should I handle this on 1 page with a split of server and client components?
Answer: For User Experience, I don't want to chuck the user around to different pages, best to keep User happy and stay on 1 page

Should I use Vite + React, or NextJS,
Answer: Vite + React would definitely keep it more simple, but decided on NextJS for the SEO, #add more
